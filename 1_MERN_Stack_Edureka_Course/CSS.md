# CSS

CSS stands for casacading style sheets which styles our web(HTML) page by using different various properties.

### How to add CSS to our HTML Files

- Inline CSS :

  Which we include in style attribute in HTML tag in opening part like `<h1 style="color:red"></h1>`.

- Internal CSS :

  Which we include inside the `<style></style>` tag inside the head tag.

- External CSS :

  In which we create **style.css** file
  and we link that file through
  `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`

### CSS Selectors

We have 3 types of CSS selectors as mentioned below.

- Class Selector :

  we can select the element by its class by **.header** as like mentioned below `.header{color:red;}`.

- ID Selector :

  we can select the element by its id by using **#header** as like mentioned
  `#header{color:red;}`.

- Element Selector :

  We can select the elements by simply element name and properties inside the **{}** like `h1{color:red;}`.

- Universal Selector :

  we can apply one style to the all the elements in our webpage universally by using **\*{font-family:sans-serif}**.

- WE can group the sectors by just putting **,** in multiple classes,id's and elements. like

  **h1,.header,#footer{color:black;}**
